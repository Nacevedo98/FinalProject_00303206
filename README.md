This project is designed to create a calculator object with various methods. There are 3 different calculator classes that are used to create the calculator. 
When running the program, the user is asked whether they would like to create a calculator using 1 value, 2 values, or 3 values. After their selection, the
user is given a menu of functions that the calculator can perform. Once the calculation is complete, the data is written to history.txt. The user can view the 
data in the history file by pressing 4 when starting up the program.
